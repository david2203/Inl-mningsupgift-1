            This week we’ll be discussing the concept of <strong>"Youtubability"</strong> - <br> 
            another important game guideline.

                    Youtubability
                </h2>
                <p>
                A key driver of youtubability is <strong>the clarity
                of your gameplay </strong> to a potential player.
                </p>
                <p>
                Gameplay clarity will help you achieve the 
                full potential of your game by working on 
                getting <strong>the lowest possible CPIs</strong> for your 
                games.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Many elements can be used to make your 
                game clearer :
                </p>
                <p>
                    For instance, ask yourself if a user’s inte
                raction with the game is <strong>evident</strong>, for 
                example, can she tell which character she 
                <strong>controls?</strong> Is the <strong>the objective clear? </strong> Does it
                look <strong>fun to play?</strong> Has she understood the 
                game after 1 second (great!) or after 10 
                seconds (too long!).
                </p>
                <p>
                Make sure to <strong>use colours</strong>> to help indicate 
                the gameplay rules. For instance, in Helix 
                Jump, obstacles are <strong>clearly contrasted</strong> (in 
                orange here) and instantly recognized as 
                a threat.

            If you want to run user tests with 
            friends and family or even random 
            people in the street, it is interesting to
            show them the 30 second video before
            making them try to prototype in order 
            to <strong>understand their</strong>> expectations from
            the video vs. the actual game they try. 
        
        </p>
        <p id="p2">
                <strong> Make it obvious </strong>>with visual elements
                that help <strong>understand the objective and
                controls</strong>> of the game, like with the
                target used in Viatcheslav Tarasov’s
                Purple Diver or Fabrika Games’ Draw
                Car with the space dedicated to
                drawing.

                People will be watching the gameplay videos of your games <strong>on their
                phone’s Facebook feed</strong>, everything will seem smaller than when 
                displayed in Unity or as a video on your computer screen. <strong>You should 
                also consider whether your gameplay video is understandable if 
                someone watches iton a small screen.</strong> With an average watch time of 3 
                to 5 seconds, this is an <strong>accelerated elevator pitch! </strong>

        <p id="margin">
                Think of the moment when you decide to click on a random video on 
                YouTube just because it has an attractive thumbnail - it’s the same idea
                for your game videos.
