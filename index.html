            This week we’ll be discussing the concept of <strong>"Youtubability"</strong> - <br> 
            another important game guideline.

                    A key driver of youtubability is <strong>the clarity of your gameplay </strong> to a potential player.Gameplay clarity will help you achieve the full potential of your game by working on getting <strong>the lowest possible CPIs</strong> for your games.Many elements can be used to make your game clearer :For instance, ask yourself if a user’s inte-raction with the game is <strong>evident</strong>, for example, can she tell which character she <strong>controls?</strong> Is the <strong>the objective clear? </strong> Does it look <strong>fun to play?</strong>> Has she understood the game after 1 second (great!) or after 10 seconds (too long!).Make sure to <strong>use colours</strong>> to help indicate the gameplay rules. For instance, in Helix Jump, obstacles are <strong>clearly contrasted</strong> (in orange here) and instantly recognized as a threat.

            &#x202e; If you want to run user tests with <br> 
            friends and family or even random <br>
            people in the street, it is interesting to<br>
            show them the 30 second video before<br>
            making them try to prototype in order <br>
            to <strong>understand their</strong>> expectations from<br>
            the video vs. the actual game they try. <br>

                controls</strong>> of the game, like with the<br>

                People will be watching the gameplay videos of your games <strong>on their<br>
                phone’s Facebook feed</strong>>, everything will seem smaller than when <br>
                displayed in Unity or as a video on your computer screen. <strong>You should <br>
                also consider whether your gameplay video is understandable if <br>
                someone watches iton a small screen.</strong> With an average watch time of 3 <br> 
                to 5 seconds, this is an <strong>accelerated elevator pitch!<br> <strong>
        </p> 
        <p>
                Think of the moment when you decide to click on a random video on<br> YouTube just because it has an attractive thumbnail - it’s the same idea <br> for your game videos.
